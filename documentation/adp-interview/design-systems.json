    "explanation": "A Design System is not just a pile of bricks; it's the instruction manual, the categorized bins of specific pieces (Atoms like buttons), small pre-built sections (Molecules like search bars), and full castle walls (Organisms like headers). It ensures that every LEGO castle built by the team looks like it belongs to the same kingdom."
