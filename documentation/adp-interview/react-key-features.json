    "explanation": "React acts as the Architect. You provide the Blueprint (JSX/Components). When data changes, the Architect redraws a new Blueprint (Virtual DOM), compares it to the old one (Diffing), and gives specific instructions to the construction crew (ReactDOM) to change *only* the parts of the building that are different (Reconciliation)."
